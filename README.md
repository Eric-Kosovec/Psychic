# Psychic
Work in progress Python-based extensible forensic tool to determine an author's identity from a given codebase. Ideal for finding quality starting points for manual investigation within a large source project.<br/>
<br/>
Parses source files for certain patterns, such as IP addresses, file paths, and URLs.<br/>
<br/>
Note:<br/>
Now uses YARA rules to describe identifiers. This tool is not meant to be completely perfect, and depending on the quality of the YARA rules, may miss some things.<br/>
